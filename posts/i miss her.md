# Thinking of You

Hey [Her Name],

I’ve been thinking about you a lot lately. Missing you isn’t a single moment—it’s every small detail that reminds me of you.

## Moments I Miss

- The way your mornings start with a smile and a coffee cup clinking in the kitchen.
- Our late-night talks that somehow solved nothing and everything at once.
- The way your hand fits perfectly in mine, even when nothing is said.

## Small Pleasures We Shared

1. The quiet walks when the city slows down.
2. Weekend breakfasts that tasted like home.
3. The playlists we built together—songs that still echo in my head.

## What I Hope For

- I hope you’re doing well, wherever you are.
- I hope we both find the little moments that remind us of each other, but in a way that brings a little more light.
- I hope time gives us clarity, not just distance.

## Closing

Until we meet again, I’ll carry you with me—quietly, warmly, and honestly.

With care,
[Your Name]
